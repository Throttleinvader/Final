# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to make a program that is able to take the entire list of yugioh cards and you can choose what type of cards you want from spell to trap while adding the card to the deck  
  - I wanna give the person the choice to pick which slot they wanna work on and to clear it 
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan to work with anyone 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I dont really know how to print the picture out and I need to figure out how to get the card files from the website
